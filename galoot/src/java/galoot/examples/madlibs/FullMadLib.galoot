<p style="width: 400px;text-align:center;">
An amusement park is always fun to visit on a hot summer
{{ randomWord(noun) }}. When you get there, you can rent a
{{ randomWord(noun) }} and go for a swim. And there are lots of
{{ randomWord(adjective) }} things to eat. You can start off with a hot dog on
a/an {{ randomWord(noun) }} with mustard, relish, and {{ randomWord(plnoun) }}
on it. Then you can have a buttered ear of {{ randomWord(noun) }} with a
nice {{ randomWord(adjective) }} slice of watermelon and a big bottle of
cold {{ randomWord(liquid) }}. When you are full, it's time to go on the
roller coaster, which should settle your {{ randomWord(noun) }}.
Other amusement park rides are the Dodge-Em which has little
{{ randomWord(plnoun) }}, that you drive and run into other {{ randomWord(plnoun) }},
and the Merry-Go-Round where you can sit on a big {{ randomWord(noun) }}
and try to grab the gold {{ randomWord(noun) }} as you ride past.
