== Introduction ==

Galoot is a templating engine written in Java, designed after the [http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/templates/ Django templating engine] for Python. Currently, this project is being developed for a compilers course and is considered to be in an early stage of development. The project uses [http://sablecc.org/ SableCC] to generate the lexer/parser from the language grammar.

  # What's up with the name?
    The name is sort of random, but not completely. Galoots Are Lovers Of Old Tools, but we think that even old dogs would love to learn a few new tricks with this library. So, if you happen to be a galoot (not the big ogre kind, but the lover of old tools kind), then we think you might want to give Galoot a chance. You might break out of your galoot-ness (for the moment) and use a NEW tool. Then, you'll become a galoot once again after you start loving Galoot. In addition, the word galoot sounds similar to the phrase "glue it", which is partially what this library lets you do: glue documents, text, and variables together!
