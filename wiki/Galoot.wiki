  # What's up with the name?
    The name is sort of completely random. If you remember the galoots from Ren & Stimpy, you might recall that they weren't too... uhh... bright. One of the goals for this project is to make templating so easy that even galoots can use it! It's sort of a nice way of saying that you don't need to be a genius to use it.
