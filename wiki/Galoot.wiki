  # What's up with the name?
    The name is sort of random, but not completely. Galoots Are Lovers Of Old Tools, but we think that even old dogs would love to learn a few new tricks with this library.  Also, if you remember the galoots from Ren & Stimpy, you might recall that they weren't too bright upstairs. One of the goals for this project is to make templating so easy that even galoots can use it. It's sort of a nice way of saying that you don't need to be a genius to look like one.
