## Introduction ##

Rover is a database query library written in Java. What makes Rover unique is that it requires no setup, allows you to do chainable queries / operations, and returns results objects as beans.

Check out the examples in subversion to get an idea of what you can do with Rover.

Rover is a work in progress, and might become a more full-fledged ORM API (allowing database mutation operations). For now, it is just a query API for fetching results.
